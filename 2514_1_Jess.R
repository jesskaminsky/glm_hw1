#ANOVA table.

#Finally, take the model you think describes the data the best and write a short report for 
#your grandmother who would like to grow these flowers carefully explaining to her how she 
#should best grow them and why. Note that your grandmother is curious about how much changes 
#in light and timing might affect her flowers and how sensitive her results will be to the 
#settings she makes.
